We should be further ahead with the national vaccination program; and seeing a more manifest change in tone in the national outlook with the Biden administration established in government and policies in effect.	I believe it will become clearer the nature of our challenges socially; environmentally; with regard to climate change; international relations; and interconnectedness generally; and about appropriate actions to address and meet these challenges accordingly.

It still doesn't take away the fact 500;000 Americans have perished from Covid-19; but I see it as being overwhelmingly optimistic. It's more of a spiritual feeling and not a physical/rational feeling.	We're now playing craps. Your guess is as good as mine. I thought about the fact that 180 days is very far from now. Anything can happen in that time. I'm 50%.	"I can barely ""see"" 2 weeks from now.

I also think most of our friends will have been vaccinated.	I think the country will be doing well if we can keep sane people in office and not the likes of the Trump administration.
